      <p>
      Hello! My name is Kevin Lesak and welcome to my portfolio page! I have had many jobs in my professional career, including Starbucks Store Manager, Bartender and Office Manager. Simply put, I wanted something new, exciting, and out of the customer service business.

      Currently, I am a Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Student. As I progress in Bootcamp, learn more skills and techniques and build more projects, my portfolio page will be updated. As of June 2020, my portfolio is virtually non-existent as I have a basic set of skills, including Javascript, MySQL, mongoDB, etc. I am only three months into Coding Bootcamp, but I am looking forward to continuing building my coding skillset. After completing Bootcamp, my #1 goal is to be employer competitive and obtain a solid job as a web developer.
